    "# Find Label Errors in Token Classification (Text) Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "This 5-minute quickstart tutorial shows how you can use cleanlab to find potential label errors in text datasets for token classification. In token-classification, our data consists of a bunch of sentences (aka documents) in which every token (aka word) is labeled with one of K classes, and we train models to predict the class of each token in a new sentence. Example applications in NLP include part-of-speech-tagging or entity recognition, which is the focus on this tutorial. Here we use the [CoNLL-2003 named entity recognition](https://deepai.org/dataset/conll-2003-english) dataset which contains around 20,000 sentences with 300,000 individual tokens. Each token is labeled with one of the following classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LOC (location entity)\n",
    "- PER (person entity)\n",
    "- ORG (organization entity)\n",
    "- MISC (miscellaneous other type of entity)\n",
    "- O (other type of word that does not correspond to an entity)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of what we'll do in this tutorial:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Find tokens with label issues using `cleanlab.token_classification.filter.find_label_issues`. \n",
    "- Rank sentences based on their overall label quality using `cleanlab.token_classification.rank.get_label_quality_scores`."

    "- `labels`: List whose `i`-th element is a list of integers corresponding to class labels of each token in the `i`-th sentence. Example: `[..., [0, 0, 1], ...]`\n",
    "- `pred_probs`: List whose `i`-th element is a np.ndarray of shape `(N_i, K)` corresponding to predicted class probabilities for each token in the `i`-th sentence (assuming this sentence contains `N_i` tokens and dataset has `K` possible classes). These should be out-of-sample `pred_probs` obtained from a token classification model via cross-validation. \n",

    "To find label issues, cleanlab requires predicted class probabilities from a trained classifier. These `pred_probs` contain a length-*K* vector for **each** token in the dataset (which sums to 1 for each token).  Here we use `pred_probs` which are out-of-sample predicted class probabilities for the full CoNLL-2003 dataset (merging training, development, and testing splits), obtained from a BERT Transformer fit via cross-validation. Our example notebook [\"Training Entity Recognition Model for Token Classification\"](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/blob/master/entity_recognition/entity_recognition_training.ipynb) contains the code to produce such `pred_probs` and save them in a `.npz` file, which we simply load here via a `read_npz` function (can skip these details)."

    "For best reviewing label issues in a token classification dataset, you want to look at sentences one at a time. Here sentences more likely to contain a label error should be ranked earlier. Cleanlab can provide an overall label quality score for each sentence (ranging from 0 to 1) such that lower scores indicate sentences more likely to contain some mislabeled token. We can also obtain label quality scores for each individual token and manually decide which of these are label issues by thresholding them. For automatically estimating which tokens are mislabeled (and the number of label errors), you should use `find_label_issues()` instead. `get_label_quality_scores()` is useful if you only have time to review a few sentences and want to prioritize which, or if you're specifically aiming to detect label errors with high precision (or high recall) rather than overall estimation of the set of mislabeled tokens."
